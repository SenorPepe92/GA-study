<!-- Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

Create a webpage with an h1 of "My Book List".
Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JS will go.

Copy this array of books:
var books = [
  {
    title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things',
    author: 'Don Norman',
    alreadyRead: false
  },
  {
    title: 'The Most Human Human',
    author: 'Brian Christian',
    alreadyRead: true
  }
];

Iterate through the array of books. 
For each book, create a p element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
Bonus: Use a ul and li to display the books.
Bonus: add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an img element for each book on the page.
Bonus: Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not. -->
